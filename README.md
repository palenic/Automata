# Finite state and pushdown automata in Python
Includes two python modules, example data and tests. The module `my_fsa` implements FSA, `my_pda` implements PDA and depends on `my_fsa`. The `data` folder contains configuration files for some automata (read by the `fsa_from_txt` and `pda_from_txt` functions). The `automata` notebook illustrates functionalities. The `tests` folder contains tests written using the `unittest` package and the `data` folder.
